### Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) with a focus on the geographic distribution of program locations. The dataset includes information about cities, categories of program beneficiaries, and their corresponding locations. The analysis aims to identify patterns in program availability and explore potential gaps in geographic coverage that could impact accessibility for at-risk populations.

### Dataset Source

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Public Database. It contains information about suppliers that provide services to eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The dataset includes details such as organization name, location, contact information, National Provider Identifier (NPI), and other relevant data points.

### Objective
To analyze the distribution and categorization of Diabetes Prevention Program initiatives across various locations in the United States. This includes identifying trends in the geographical presence of initiatives, understanding the categories of services provided, and detecting potential gaps or opportunities for improving program reach and accessibility.

### Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
2. Geographical Distribution of Inititaives
3. Categorization of Initiatives
4. Volume of Initiatives

### Results
1. The analysis revealed significant variation in the geographical distribution of the initiatives. States like Orlando, Newyork, and Carlifornia reported the highest number of initiatives, whereas states like Alaska, Rhode Island, and New Mexico had fewer, suggesting a need for targeted outreach in less-served regions. This indicates a concentration of resources in populous states, which could mean underserved areas in rural or smaller states may benefit from additional programs to ensure nationwide coverage.
2. Certain states, such as Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota, have fewer than five initiatives, signaling a potential gap in coverage.
3. Most of the initiatives are administrative in nature, with fewer offering community services. The focus on administrative locations highlights the need for expanding direct program offerings to reach more beneficiaries effectively.
4. A small number of organizations are responsible for the majority of initiatives. The top three organizations accounted for over 48% of all recorded initiatives.
   
### Recommendations
1. There is a need to focus on underserved states, and strategically expand initiatives in states especially with fewer than five programs.
2. Exploring collaborations with additional providers could help decentralize and broaden the reach of the Diabetes Prevention Program.
